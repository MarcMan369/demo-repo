# Demo Repository 

This repository is to learn properly how to use GitHub.

Although I have had a GitHub account for 2 years, I have not use it in its full capacity
as I was still studying Cybersecurity, and therefore learning about things not directly related to coding.
I have cloned some Blockchain projects for my Master degree's final project.

Now, with the Le Wagon Bootcamo, I will learn and become a Full Stack Web Developer!

THIS IS A LOCAL CHANGE, DONE IN MY I7
